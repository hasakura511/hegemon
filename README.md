# Hegemon Prototype

This repository contains a prototype for **Civ 8 - Hegemon AI**. It now models a player civilization and multiple AI opponents, complete with objectives, events, and a simple opponent turn system.

## Running

Ensure you have Python 3 installed and run:

```bash
python3 civ8.py
```

Use natural language commands like:

- `status`
- `objectives`
- `invest innovation & tech leadership`
- `broadcast neo-rome`
- `trade vultari`
- `military neo-rome`
- `end`
- `quit`

After each action, the advisor reports updated Dalio Pillar values and objective progress.
