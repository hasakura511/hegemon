# Hegemon Prototype

This repository contains a simple prototype for **Civ 8 - Hegemon AI**. It simulates the Dalio Power Pillars for a single civilization and provides a basic text-driven advisor loop.

## Running

Ensure you have Python 3 installed and run:

```bash
python3 civ8.py
```

Type commands such as `what's our status?`, `invest in education & human capital`, `end turn`, or `quit` to interact with the advisor.
