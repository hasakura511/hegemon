# Hegemon Prototype

This repository contains a prototype for **Civ 8 - Hegemon AI**. It now models two civilizations (the Player and Neo-Rome) and introduces simplified hegemonic objectives and actions.

## Running

Ensure you have Python 3 installed and run:

```bash
python3 civ8.py
```

Use natural language commands like:

- `what's our status?`
- `display hegemonic objectives`
- `invest in innovation & tech leadership`
- `propose favorable trade deal to neo-rome`
- `end turn`
- `quit`

After each action, the advisor reports updated Dalio Pillar values and objective progress.
